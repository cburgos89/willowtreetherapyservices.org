                Welcome to Willow Tree Therapy Services. I'm Amanda Bailey, an
                experienced Licensed Mental Health Counselor (LMHC) and
                Registered Play Therapist. I'm here to provide you with genuine
                support and effective therapy for your journey towards healing
                and growth.
              </p>
              <p>
                My educational background includes an undergraduate degree in
                Psychology from Stetson University in 2008, followed by a
                Masters in Clinical Mental Health Counseling in 2017. I hold a
                current license from the State of Florida, license #17759.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a Registered Play Therapist certified by the Association of
                Play Therapy with registration #T4930, I specialize in working
                with children in the foster care system, adoptive families, and
                those facing trauma and behavioral challenges.
              </p>
              <p>
                My practical experience spans across different settings,
                including working within a full-service schools program and an
                outpatient mental health clinic. In 2018, I became a part of the
                mental health counseling team for Baker County Public School
                System, where I've provided valuable services to students
                ranging from PreK to high school.
              </p>
              <p>
                With over 9 years of experience in the child welfare field, I've
                held roles such as case manager, adoption recruiter, and
                post-adoption specialist. This background has provided me with
                deep insights into the complexities of child welfare, which
                inform my empathetic and effective therapeutic approach.
              </p>
              <p>
                In February 2020, I established Willow Tree Therapy Services, a
                practice dedicated to serving kids and families in Baker County.
                I'm proud to have a partnership with the First Coast Child
                Protection Team, expanding my ability to support those in need.
              </p>
              <p>
                Continuously striving to enhance my therapeutic methods, I
                incorporate play therapy techniques to create a comfortable and
                effective counseling experience. I'm excited to announce my plan
                to bring an intern on board, which will contribute to the growth
                and development of my practice.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thank you for considering Willow Tree Therapy Services.
                Together, we can navigate challenges and work towards positive
                change.
