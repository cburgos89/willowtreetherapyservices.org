                When I was a young girl, a tall weeping willow tree grew in the
                corner of my backyard. There were many sunny afternoons spent
                under the branches of that tree. The tree became a meeting spot
                for my friends and me, a place where our imaginations ran free
                and we could be whoever we wanted. We were Olympic gymnasts,
                teachers, parents, chefs, veterinarians, and any other
                occupation we desired. We explored the area under the branches
                as if it were an unknown land, the deepest parts of the ocean,
                or a desert far out west. When we were under that willow tree,
                we were free to be children. In those days, we walked like
                giants conquering the world. I learned about the process of
                grieving as we buried pets under that tree and as I grew older,
                it became a place of solace, while I journaled and envisioned my
                future.

                While creating a space for my private practice, I was brought
                back to memories of the willow. I wanted to create that same
                safe space for children to explore their inner feelings, use
                their imaginations, and resolve some of their most difficult
                struggles. I believe that children are inherently able to move
                forward to their own self-actualization through empathetic
                understanding and communicating through their language of play.
