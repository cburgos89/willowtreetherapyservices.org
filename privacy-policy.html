              <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
              <p>
                When does a therapist have to break confidentiality with a
                client?
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  If the client may be an immediate danger to himself or others.
                  In this instance, I will take measures that are required of me
                  by law in order to ensure the safety of the client. If the
                  client is threatening serious bodily harm to another
                  individual, I must notify the police and inform the intended
                  victim.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the client is endangering a population that cannot protect
                  itself, such as the case of child or elder abuse.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To share diagnosis information as necessary to obtain payment
                  for services.
                </li>
                <li>As required by federal or state laws.</li>
              </ol>

              <h2>Office Policy</h2>
              <p>
                During all appointments, adults must stay on the premises for
                the entirety of the session while their minor child is being
                seen. This is to ensure the safety of the minor client.
              </p>

              <h2>What will happen during therapy?</h2>
              <p>
                You can contact me for a free 15 minute phone consultation to
                inquire if my services would benefit your family. If you are
                interested in scheduling an appointment, paperwork will be sent
                to you through a confidential link. These forms will be needed
                for our first session together.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the first session, parents will be required to attend
                with their child. We will review informed consent and
                expectations of treatment. I will gather information regarding
                your family history, concerns, and goals to formulate a
                treatment plan for the remainder of our sessions. We will
                discuss the expected length of therapy. It can be difficult
                sharing information with an unfamiliar person and I applaud your
                strength for making the first step to coming to therapy.
                Throughout our first session, I will make every effort to build
                rapport and answer any questions you have regarding the
                counseling process. At times, we would like changes to happen
                immediately but those changes will not occur during our first
                session. Please expect our first intake session to take 90
                minutes.
              </p>
              <p>
                During individual sessions with your child, I will check in with
                the parent before/after the session. During the session, I will
                utilize evidenced-based interventions with your child. These
                interventions may include playing, drawing/painting, acting,
                bibliotherapy, and much more! Not all sessions bring about
                positive feelings due to sensitive topics being discussed. While
                working through the process, there will be a range of emotions
                expressed while we work toward healing. These sessions will
                either be 45 minutes or 60 minutes (the agreed upon time).
              </p>
              <p>
                For family sessions, I will meet with the parents/parent and
                client. During these family sessions, I may observe parent and
                child interaction to provide feedback that may benefit the
                relationship. We will discuss family dynamics that are
                interfering with family functioning and home interventions that
                can be utilized to continue healing at home. All sessions
                normally occur once per week, or as agreed upon at intake.
