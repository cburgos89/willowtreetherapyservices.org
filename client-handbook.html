                Individual/Family Session (90 minutes - $140).&nbsp; While
                sessions are not conducted by phone, if an emergency phone
                consultation is initiated by the client, the first 15-minutes
                are at no charge. However, $25.00 will be billed to your account
                for each subsequent 15- minute period. I understand that if I
                have insurance, Willow Tree Therapy Services, LLC will either
                file the claim on my behalf or will provide me with the
                necessary information so that I can file the claim. I understand
                that I am ultimately responsible for any therapy fee(s) not
                covered by my insurance carrier. Co-pays and non-covered
                services are payable at time of service unless other
                arrangements have been made. In the event that insurance is
                billed on my (the client) behalf, I authorize payment of mental
                health benefits to Willow Tree Therapy Services, LLC.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the event of a lapse of insurance coverage; the client has
                three options.&nbsp;
              </p>
              <p>
                1. Continue with services and pay the full therapy fees as
                listed above.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Request a referral to a provider who accepts insurance or
                your preferred method of payment.
              </p>
              <p>3. Request to be discharged from services.</p>

                <strong>No-Show/Late Cancellation Charge:</strong>
              </h4>
              <p>
                ppreciate prompt arrival for appointments. Please notify me at
                904-349-5299 for any late arrivals. If a client does not provide
                notice within 24 hours of his/her scheduled appointment, a fee
                of $75 will be charged to the client’s account and will be asked
                to pay this balance prior to scheduling his/her next
                appointment. Clients may leave a message on Willow Tree Therapy
                Services, LLC voicemail to cancel an appointment; however this
                message must be left at least 24 hours before the scheduled
                appointment. If you are more than 15 minutes late for a session,
                your appointment may be cancelled and a fee will be added to
                your account. If we have a reoccurring appointment, I will wait
                for 24 hours after the missed appointment to confirm for the
                next scheduled appointment. If there is no contact, you will be
                discharged or placed on a waiting list. This is to ensure that
                you are not charged two times for a no-show fee.
              </p>
              <p>
                If insurance prohibits this therapist from charging a no-show
                fee, I will allow one “no show” before I must consider the
                professional relationship discontinued, for ethical and legal
                purposes.&nbsp; If court ordered, a summary outlining reason for
                discharge will be provided including dates of missed sessions.

              <p>
                &nbsp;This document contains important information about federal
                law, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
                (HIPAA), that provides privacy protections and patient rights
                with regard to the use and disclosure of your Protected Health
                Information (PHI) used for the purpose of treatment, payment,
                and health care operations.&nbsp; HIPAA requires that we provide
                you with a Notice of Privacy Practices (the Notice) for use and
                disclosure of PHI for treatment, payment and health care
                operations.&nbsp; The Notice, which is attached to this
                Agreement, explains HIPAA and its application to your PHI in
                greater detail.&nbsp; The law requires that we obtain your
                signature acknowledging that we have provided you with
                this.&nbsp; If you have any questions, it is your right and
                obligation to ask so we can have a further discussion prior to
                signing this document.&nbsp; When you sign this document, it
                will also represent an agreement between us.&nbsp; You may

              <p>&nbsp;LIMITS ON CONFIDENTIALITY</p>
              <p>
                &nbsp;The law protects the privacy of all communication between
                a patient and a therapist.&nbsp; In most situations, we can only
                release information about your treatment to others if you sign a
                written authorization form that meets certain legal requirements
                imposed by HIPAA.&nbsp; There are some situations where we are
                permitted or required to disclose information without either
                your consent or authorization. If such a situation arises, we
                will limit my disclosure to what is necessary.&nbsp; Reasons we
                may have to release your information without authorization:
              </p>
              <p>
                1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are involved in a court proceeding
                and a request is made for information concerning your diagnosis
                and treatment, such information is protected by the
                psychologist-patient privilege law.&nbsp; We cannot provide any
                information without your (or your legal representative's)
                written authorization, or a court order, or if we receive a
                subpoena of which you have been properly notified and you have
                failed to inform us that you oppose the subpoena.&nbsp; If you
                are involved in or contemplating litigation, you should consult
                with an attorney to determine whether a court would be likely to
                order us to disclose information.
              </p>
              <p>
                2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a government agency is requesting the
                information for health oversight activities, within its
                appropriate legal authority, we may be required to provide it
                for them.
              </p>
              <p>
                3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a patient files a complaint or lawsuit
                against us, we may disclose relevant information regarding that
                patient in order to defend ourselves.
              </p>
              <p>
                4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a patient files a worker's compensation
                claim, and we are providing necessary treatment related to that
                claim, we must, upon appropriate request, submit treatment
                reports to the appropriate parties, including the patient's
                employer, the insurance carrier or an authorized qualified
                rehabilitation provider.
              </p>
              <p>
                5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may disclose the minimum necessary
                health information to Valladares Therapy Services &amp;
                Consulting business associates that perform functions on our
                behalf or provide us with services if the information is
                necessary for such functions or services.&nbsp; Our business
                associates sign agreements to protect the privacy of your
                information and are not allowed to use or disclose any
                information other than as specified in our contract.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are some situations in which we are legally obligated to
                take actions, which we believe are necessary to attempt to
                protect others from harm, and we may have to reveal some
                information about a patient's treatment:
              </p>
              <p>
                1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we know, or have reason to suspect, that
                a child under 18 has been abused, abandoned, or neglected by a
                parent, legal custodian, caregiver, or any other person
                responsible for the child's welfare, the law requires that we
                file a report with the Florida Abuse Hotline.&nbsp; Once such a
                report is filed, we may be required to provide additional
                information.
              </p>
              <p>
                2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we know or have reasonable cause to
                suspect, that a vulnerable adult has been abused, neglected, or
                exploited, the law requires that we file a report with the
                Florida Abuse Hotline.&nbsp; Once such a report is filed, we may
                be required to provide additional information.
              </p>
              <p>
                3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we believe that there is a clear and
                immediate probability of physical harm to the patient, to other
                individuals, or to society, we may be required to disclose
                information to take protective action, including communicating
                the information to the potential victim, and/or appropriate
                family member, and/or the police or to seek hospitalization of
                the patient.
